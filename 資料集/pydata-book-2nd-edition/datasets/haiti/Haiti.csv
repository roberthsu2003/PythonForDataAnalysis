Please share this info far and wide:

Located at Santo 25, Rue Canaan #26, they have

NO shelter

NO latrines or other means of sanitation

NO access to potable water

NO food

There are about 20 amputees with no access to medical care

There are about 300 children from 2-12 years of age

There are about 20 infants

I have written Jack Harding (Camp Registration) about their situation.

FULL TEXT:

Good-morning,

My name is Meme Selvandieu, Président/ Fondateur de la Fondation Rocher du Salut d'Haiti (FROCSAH).

I found your contact searching on the Internet http://helphaitiheal.wordpress.com/shelters-camps/ (Help Haiti Heal) and https://www.cimicweb.org/cmo/haiti/Pages/default.aspx (CMO Haiti) and with the help of two Italian friends abroad (Mauro Annarumma - Doctor in the Italian Army mauro.annarumma@gmail.com and Raphael Broniatowski - Volonteer in the Italian Red Cross raphael.bro@cripadova.it)


I'm writing you to request assistance for 200 families, including mine.

We are 30 people without shelter and assistance since January 12th. The other ones need food, medicines and clothes.


The friends I have contacted in Italy are trying to get in touch with the Italian Delegation of the Red Cross in Haiti through its headquarter in Rome but time is passing and we haven't received any help yet.

I understand you may be too busy to treat directly our kind of request but maybe you can tell us about new distributions of tents and  reliefs in Pétion-Ville and where they are suppose to happen.

We all thank you very much for any kind of help you could give us.

We will be waiting for an answer.","1. Urgences | Emergency, 5. Infrastructure Damage, 2. Urgences logistiques | Vital Lines, 4. Menaces | Security Threats, 7. Secours | Services Available, 8. Autre | Other, 6. Natural Hazards, 3. Public Health, ",18.511458,-72.286767,YES,NO

I am a retired Firefighter doing some relief work in Haiti. I have a home in North Carolina but am living in the Dominican republic for the last few months.  After the quake I was asked by some doctor friends to lead a trip to do medical work there so on the 4th day after the quake we went in.  I am back in Haiti now preparing for the next visit of the same group. 
Story:
Last night a small camp of 1200 people were forced off the property they were camped on.  This was a camp that we had provided medical help to. This was done at night and with no warning.  1200 people moved out in darkness with no place to go many children many wounded were put out into the night. What is worse it was done by a supposed Catholic group at Villa Manrese.  The people were living behind the building on a flat spot of ground.  They were a very organized group and were in a safe place.  They had a small school there for the children.  They had food that they shared.  The directors name at Villa Manrese is Pere Andre Paul Grraud. I do not know what he knows about this but he was there in the house above the camp.  I have video of before and after this was done. I understand the need to remove the people from the property but the way they went about this must be reported.  This sort of thing has to be addressed and exposed to the world.  These people were treated like cattle and by fellow Haitians of a Catholic group. 

I am leaving Haiti Thursday for the DR but will be back in 2 weeks.  I will gladly share the video with you.

This e-mail appears to be circulating widely on the internet today (2/10/10) but I did not see it reported here after searching a .csv file of Ushahidi reports for the last 10 days. 

The e-mail also states that Haitians receiving medical treatment in the Dominican Republic have undergone unnecessary amputations and other medical procedures.  

The report originated with Mr. Carl Telemaque. His phone number is 3711 - 1771 but he may soon loose power or service.

I talked to a Renelus Maxime who answered the phone. He is likely a “pastor”. His church (a poor one) supports them. The orphanage house 26 children. The house collapsed. They are now in an area called Villier. But he has now many more children from the school supported by the church. I was coming from dowtown to buy some food.
I told him to come to BICHaiti to ask for assistance if he qualifies for it.

Avec quelques amis, je suis en contact depuis des années avec un ami en Haïti, il est à Port-au-Prince dans le quartier de Delmas 24. Apparemment ce quartier n'a reçu l'aide d'aucune organisation humanitaire, que ce soit en nourriture, eau ou tentes.  Certains sortent bien du quartier pour aller chercher nourriture et eau ailleurs:  des queues de 1000 personnes et pour finir ce sont les plus violents qui emportent les denrées. 
116 personnes se trouvent dans un abri provisoire: Rue Caonabo, Delmas 24. Parmi elles, également une femme enceinte et des enfants, parfois en bas âge. 
Selon notre dernière communication, leurs besoins les plus urgent sont  &quot;50 tentes familiales, de l’eau et de la nourriture, des medicaments et des habits surtout pour les enfants ( une vingtaine)&quot;.

The family was supposed to fly back to Montreal on Jan. 20.9166

William says he’s tried every phone number he could think of and got nowhere.

“I’ve been hearing stories of people texting to tell they are okay, and I’m hoping my cousin will also do the same,” he says.

Jean was going to travel a bit in Haiti but was mostly planning to be in Port-au- Prince, where her mother lived.IMG_0335

“I’m not sure, but I think she was in Port (au Prince) when the earthquake struck. We are hoping she and the kids are okay ... maybe they have just not been able to find a phone to call us.” 

Jean, who is divorced from her husband, worked in Montreal.

“She was taking a vacation after so long,” says William.

1062,Jacmel Airport Aid Station - correction,18/01/2010 11:01,Jacmel,"I was wrong about the status of my team; I received a cell phone picture of them boarding a charter and assumed it was Santiago but it was in CONUS; they will not be in place until sometime Tuesday.  Will update again when I know more.

6-7 firefigher-paramedics on the charter with all supplies except schedule-1 drugs (morpheine), &quot;two SUVs full&quot;.  2 more flying commercially, all joining container(s) of supplies from CARE at Ft Lauderdale for the hop into DR Tuesday AM, deploying Jacmel Tuesday PM if all goes well.

Organization of team with similar composition to relieve our initial team is progressing well, though nothing is certain at this point.

Our team will not have a translator initially but I have some who are attempting to arrange independent travel.  One is in Great Britain and his wife is already in Haiti, he knows all the formal languages of the Americas plus Hebrew and ASL but lacks Creole.  He is attempting to find a donor for airfare, help if you can.

Our team will need resupply with water and, if possible food.  They left much of that in the trucks, loading to weight limit with medical supplies instead.  With Jacmel now supplied by sea I don't expect that to be a huge issue though.

Sorry about the incorrect initial report, I was not kept in the loop as they scrambled for a flight and I lept to the wrong conclusion based on outdated and incomplete information.  

Any intelligence or liaison information you can get to me would be helpful; I need to prepare a full briefing for them on mission options first thing in the morning.","7.

They have signs all over saying &quot;no food or water.need food and water&quot; , the help that came to them two days ago has left and the people are hungry, tired, traumatized and wanting water. 

Today, the founder of people in need partnership,www.pinpartnership.org walked the streets, and looked for some of our missing partners. He said people are frantically looking for help. Not just food, they need medical assistance and there are still reports of people trapped inside there homes. 

The hostel that is a frequent stop for most of the doctors with no borders, missionaries and non-profit organizations , as well as a house for boys that are abandoned was collapsed, and everyone speculated that the founder was dead. He was sitting in front of the now collapsed building guarding it. Father Michael is alive. I was able to see this magical place, that will always be in my memories.

Our staff is all accounted for and we are now beginning efforts to find the partners. What has happened to Haiti, is a tragic event that is turning into a nightmare. Before three weeks ago, I was in Haiti. There was so many starving hungry people, and some would ask for water. Now, all are asking for everything.

We will start bringing in supplies in two weeks and hopefully with the help of other volunteers try to help the people of Haiti survive. I heard from a source, that there is no one leading the people of Haiti.

In the orphanage, there are about 80 babies between ages of 0 and 2 years. If you can provide any of these basic necessities, you will probably save some of these children since the orphanage is out of food and water. There will be people at the orphanage to receive any supplies. If you prefer to call to arrange a pickup, that will be OK.

&gt; I received word this morning that both the Aristide Foundation for
&gt; Democracy and the Medical University at Tabarre survived the
&gt; earthquake. They are receiving refugees and injured people -- 10,000
&gt; people are there right now.   They are providing medical care as
&gt; possible, as well as shelter and food.  There are 53 doctors on site
&gt; now (Cuban doctors who were carrying on mobile clinics in Haiti prior
&gt; to the earthquake and young Haitian doctors who recently finished
&gt; their training in Cuba).  But no medical supplies left.  Both
&gt; locations have large buildings and huge courtyard.  They are literally
&gt; five minutes from the airport -- over a road that is passable (Blvd 15
&gt; Octobre) in Tabarre.   There is also ample room to store supplies, and
&gt; a disciplined staff to manage them.  Both sites have generators, but
&gt; are running low on gas.  And are running out of water and food.
&gt;
&gt; My former colleagues at the Foundation got through a desperate plea to
&gt; ask us to help from this end to see if we can get them supplies.  I
&gt; have been trying to get them added to the Red Cross distribution list
&gt; through various contacts.  If anyone can assist with this -- or
&gt; suggest anyone other way to get medical supplies to them I would
&gt; greatly appreciate it. They not in the official NGO circuit.
&gt;
&gt; There are two contact people for the Foundation and the Medical School
&gt; in Haiti.  Toussaint Hilaire - local phone 491-4465 (the phone is
&gt; working off and on.) Also Paola Iten -  She can be reached in the
&gt; evenings at 514 664-1346.
&gt;
&gt; If people have more questions I can be reached here in Minneapolis
&gt; (612) 202-0356.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for any help you can give.

&gt; Continue straight and down a steep hill that had one bridge completed and another under construction spanning a deep ravine.  Continue 
straight to the second street.  There is a tree on an island in the middle of the road.  Shortly afterward the road splits.  Take the 
right fork, which curves very sharply to the right and up a steep hill.  The house is the property around which the road curves.  Its gate is the first one on the right.

Bresma has 3 buildings in PaP : it appears Bresma I is okay (and those are the ones for which we had coordinates), and the children from Bresma II have been transferred there. Bresma II is listed as being a &quot;little damaged&quot;. Bresma III also has damaged buildings, and children have been transferred to the guest house.

is George Sada. He is registered with the US embassy. He lives at #8 Rue
Merisier Prolonge in Musseau. He in near Delmas 48 and Delmas 60. He can be
reached by Rue Merisier or Impasse Roussan Prolonge.



I spoke with him on Weds morning at 3:30 and he seemed disoriented and could
not tell us if he had enough food and water for a couple of days. We can no
longer reach him and are very worried. He is 71 years old and a  cardiac
patient. He has medicine but we can't be sure he is taking it. He was afraid
to go back into the house and we don't know if it is still structurally
sound. He is alone and we can't reach anyone around him to go and check on
him.

My mother used to work for the US embassy and we always keep in touch just
in case something happens.
Can you find out any information regarding my father? Maybe if there is a
rescue team in the area someone can check on him.  He told me that there was
a hotel up the street from him that collapsed but that his immediate
neighbors are ok.



Thank you for any information you can gather.

Depth: 10 km (6.2 miles) set by location program

The January 12, 2010, Haiti earthquake occurred in the boundary region separating the Caribbean plate and the North America plate. This plate boundary is dominated by left-lateral strike slip motion and compression, and accommodates about 20 mm/y slip, with the Caribbean plate moving eastward with respect to the North America plate.

Haiti occupies the western part of the island of Hispaniola, one of the Greater Antilles islands, situated between Puerto Rico and Cuba. At the longitude of the January 12 earthquake, motion between the Caribbean and North American plates is partitioned between two major east-west trending, strike-slip fault systems -- the Septentrional fault system in northern Haiti and the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault system in southern Haiti.

The location and focal mechanism of the earthquake are consistent with the event having occurred as left-lateral strike slip faulting on the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault system. This fault system accommodates about 7 mm/y, nearly half the overall motion between the Caribbean plate and North America plate.

The Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault system has not produced a major earthquake in recent decades. The EPGFZ is the likely source of historical large earthquakes in 1860, 1770, 1761, 1751, 1684, 1673, and 1618, though none of these has been confirmed in the field as associated with this fault.","6c.

11,Haiti: Earthquake - Jan 2010 / SiRep,12/01/2010 04:53,"17km south-west of Port-au-Prince (18.45N, 72.45W)","This report was issued by the Office of the Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs in New York. The next report will be issued on or around 13 January 2010.

A powerful earthquake of 7.0 magnitude (USGS) on the Richter Scale affected Haiti on 12 January, at 16.53hrs local time (GMT 21.53hrs). The earthquake happened 17km south-west of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti (18.45N, 72.45W). Initial reports suggest a high number of casualties and widespread damage, with an urgent need for Search and Rescue.
A United Nations Disaster and Assessment coordination Team (UNDAC) is being mobilized.                               II. Situation Overview
On Tuesday 12 January, at approximately 16.53hrs local time, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake on the Richter
Scale, and less than 10 km deep, was recorded off the coast of Haiti, and only 17 km from the capital, Port-
au-Prince. Aftershocks have been felt measuring 5.9 and 5.5 respectively. More aftershocks are expected in
the coming hours.
The mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to mobilize and coordinate effective and
principled humanitarian action in partnership with national and international actors.
The capital of Haiti, Port-au-Prince, has been severely affected including critical city infrastructure
components such as, electricity, water and phone services. Electricity is not available and communications
are difficult. Initial reports indicate a large number of casualties and widespread damage.
At this stage there is very limited access because of debris and other obstacles on the roads. The airport of
Port-au-Prince is reported to be closed. The Presidential Palace and Government buildings are reported to
have been seriously damaged. According to preliminary reports, several UN and well as other national
buildings have collapsed or have been damaged. Populations may also be affected in Carrefour and Jacmel. 
United Nations agencies, as well as the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Society
are preparing the deployment of teams and humanitarian assistance, notably from their regional hub in
Panama. USAID/OFDA is sending a response team in addition to 2 USAR (Urban Search and Rescue) heavy
teams.
OCHA is mobilizing a United Nations Disaster and Assessment Coordination Team (UNDAC) and is
deploying staff from its Regional Office in Panama.
There has been no immediate report of damage in Cuba and the Dominican Republic. Tsunami alerts were
lifted, including for Haiti.
III. Humanitarian Needs and Response
Evacuation of injured, medical supplies and expertise are needed. Also clean water may be urgently needed
very soon.
IV. Funding
All humanitarian partners including donors and recipient agencies are encouraged to inform FTS of cash and
in-kind contributions by sending an email to: fts@reliefweb.int.

She had arrived at the hotel just two hours before the quake struck, shaking the walls of her room shook and knocking things off it.

She immediately went out and started taking pictures on the surrounding streets. The wall at the front of the hotel had fallen down and killed someone. A number of nearby buildings had collapsed, trapping people. A woman was crying and saying, “My uncle, my uncle.” A bank building was very badly damaged in the Rue Capois which runs along the side of the hotel. People were screaming. “It was general mayhem,” she said.

By 6:30, she said, it was dark and fires were burning downtown, near the shoreline.","5a. Structure effondres | Collapsed structure, ",18.538328,-72.333067,YES,NO
